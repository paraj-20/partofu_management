Project Overview

Build a full-stack Team Management Web Application with role-based access, task assignment & tracking, and a package management system.
The app will be used by an internal team and admins.
The system must be secure, modular, scalable, and fully functional (no dummy features).

Use Neon (serverless PostgreSQL) as the cloud database.
All features must be fully wired to the database and working end-to-end.

Tech Requirements

Final Instruction

This is NOT a demo app.
This is a real internal production-ready Team Management Web App.

Every feature described above must:

Exist

Be connected to the database

Be role-restricted

Be fully functional

Build the app in a modular, maintainable way so features can be extended later without rewriting the whole system.


My neon connection string : psql 'postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_4uws8vlyrCec@ep-polished-surf-a1ii39gu-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require'

My company/ project name is PartOfU.
I have also attached the logo of my company.
I am giving all the permission of neon to you.
Keep dark theme.
Admin email : paraj.panchani.2006
Admin password : paraj2006
Use this admin data to login the admin, further admin can change this from the settings in web app.

Minor bug (Here the admin email is a email as paraj.panchani.2006@gmail.com not just a username, and after giving correct details, the app says welcome back, the blue loader comes and then again I am redirected to the signup page only again & again, please solve this issue
)

Please complete the project by keeping this all thing in mind.
